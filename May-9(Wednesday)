I prepared chapathi and potato masala for breakfast.
I listen some videos in twitter elglish learning. It was very useful information to me.
I slept after 3.P.M.to 6.P.M. I read task 1 essay in the evening.
I went to cycle park at 6.30.P.M. for running.
I had dinner then I did my work.
Nowadays I did running so I had leg pain and got tired.
