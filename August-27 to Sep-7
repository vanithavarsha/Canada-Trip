I would like to visit Niagara Falls so I request to Kumar for arrange trip on August 26 th.
Kumar thought about trip because If I dont get student visa definitelly I will go to India so he arranged 3 day trip.
My brother and Suvi  have September first week long week end leave If I missed this leave there is no chance for to visit Niagara falls.
There was sevier wind in our resediency area on Wednesday so our house roof's small part damaged.
Our neighbourhood told about our roof damage on Thursday evening.
Kumar took work from home on Friday for arrange roof repairement. We finished roof repair wook at 4 pm.
Then we conformed for trip otherwise we couldnt go to trip because weather showed Saturday and Sunday rainy day.
We packed dress,water, and snacks for trip on Friday night.
We woke up around 2.30 A.M. then took shower and all things kept in the car , got ready to journey at 4.15 AM. on Septenber 1st 2018.
The distance of Niagara falls from home to 700 kilometers.
Kumar drove car for entire trip. 
On the way we stoped car in "ONroute" for had breakfast and washroom.
ONroute facility is very useful for long trip travellers. Every 70 or 80 kilometers have one ONroute.
ONroute have Gas station,cafe shop like Tim Hortens, Mc Donnals and Subway. Its have  car parking facility.
We before entered Toronto stoped 2 Onroute stop.
Toronto is a big city compare to Montreal. We reached Toronto city at 10.30 PM. but we reached Niagara falls at 1.30.P.M.
Toronto city have more highrays building and broad highway road facility.
