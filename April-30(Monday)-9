I went to Libruary morning at 11.30A.M.
It opened at 1.P.M. so I sit outside of the libruary. 
Many students and parents visit libruary for take book.
Even small kids also visit libruary. I was impressing for people activity.
I thought 4 years kids searched books then entered in the computer and get receipt.
Every student had taken atlest 4 or 5 books.
Different types of CD aviliable in the libruary like action and commedy movies.
Students take this CD and watch in the home.
Students and parents were very active in the afternoon to evening. 
Students learnt many things themselves.
This type of activity I never seen in my native places.
I learnt importance of Libruary for primary school children.
Parents also should co-coperate with their children.
I came to home at evening 5.P.M. I slept fron 6.P.M to 9.P.M.
Kumar bought new sim card for me. I used first day international level sim card in my phone.
I thought these fecilities  give to my daughters definitely.
When I will reach my gole everything will possible. I hope me.
