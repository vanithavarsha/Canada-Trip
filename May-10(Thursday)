I had breakfast then Suvitha,Kabilan and I went to Elgar street for kids play room.
This was first time I went to this place.
Thre were many kids came to play with their mother. 
There were lots of different toys present in that room.
Kids played and enjoyed. Thursday and Friday will open this room for kids.
I is a good opportunity for kids to play with many toys.
I didnt never went this type of place before. 
I spent somehours in the room. 
Suvitha went to driving class in the afternoon so I take care of Kabilan.
I didnt write essay for the past few days, so Kumar scold me.
